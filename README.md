## 🧑‍💻 What were good points of this project?

When my crome-app project finished, I realized that my javascript level is too low. Then I spent almost 2 months to study core javascript such as event loop, call stack, All of Array methods, execution context, closure etc..

I actually have no chance to use all of them but I think my javascript level became much better than before (my first crome-app project).
